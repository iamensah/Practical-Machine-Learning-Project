    "# Australian Weather Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "- This Project Predict the next-day rain by training classification model (Logistic Regression) on the target variable RainTomorrow. The target variable RainTomorrow means: Did it rain the next day? Yes or No.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The dataset used contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features description\n",
    "- RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Date: the date of the observation\n",

    "- Rainfall: The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaporation: The so-called Class A pan evaporation(mm) in the 25 hours to 9am\n",

    "- Pressure9am: Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am\n",
    " \n",
    "- Pressure3pm: Atmospheric pressure(hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm\n",
    " \n",
    "- Cloud9am: Fraction of the sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in “oktas” which are unit of eighths.\n",
